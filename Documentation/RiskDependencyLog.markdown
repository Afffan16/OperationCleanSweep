# ⚠️ Risk & Dependency Log

| Category | Risk/Dependency | Impact Level | Mitigation Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Skill Gap | No prior UE5/game dev experience | High | Follow structured tutorials, limit scope initially |
| Team Size | Only 2 active developers | Medium | Clear role division, focus on MVP first |
| Asset Readiness | Delays in finding or fitting models/maps | Medium | Assign Umar fully to asset handling, use placeholders |
| Engine Updates | UE5 patches may break project | Low | Lock version after stable setup |
| Hardware Limit | System limitations for development/testing | High | Optimize graphics, avoid large world assets |
| AI Complexity | Behavior tree setup more complex than expected | Medium | Start with basic chase-shoot, expand later |
| Scope Creep | Adding too many features beyond time/resources | High | Stick to planned sprints, finalize features by Week 7 |
| Integration Lag | Time-consuming BP to C++ integration | Medium | Only use Blueprints for static visuals/UI |
| Project Storage | Drive limit or loss of data on Google Drive | Medium | Keep weekly local backups and GitHub (docs) copy |
| Demo Readiness | Delayed polishing due to bugs or visuals | Medium | Start polish at least 2 weeks before final deadline (Aug 15) |
